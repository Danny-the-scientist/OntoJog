Serum is thought to provide basic elements required for cell culture, including growth factors, attachment factors, iron transporters, vitamins, amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates, hormones, and trace elements. Fetal bovine serum (FBS), also called fetal calf serum (FCS), comes from the blood drawn from a bovine (cow) fetus via a closed system of collection at the slaughterhouse. FBS/FCS is the most widely used serum-supplement for the in vitro cell culture of eukaryotic cells. This is due to it having a very low level of antibodies and containing more growth factors, allowing for versatility in many different cell culture applications. Serum contains many factors that are not
 controlled for, which can have a direct or indirect effect on the cells in culture, thus creating significant variability between suppliers and lots from a single supplier. Different methods, such as heat inactivation or dialysis, are sometimes used to eliminate undesired components (such as labile growth factors, vitamins, etc. or the complement system). Some suppliers test serum for the presence of other factors such as tetracylcine or mycoplasma.",,,,,

The assay is based on measurement of a conserved and constitutive protease activity within live cells and therefore serves as a biomarker of cell viability. The live-cell protease activity is restricted to intact viable cells and is measured using a fluorogenic, cell-permeant, peptide substrate (Gly-Phe-AFC). The substrate enters intact cells, where it is cleaved by the live-cell protease activity to generate a fluorescent signal proportional to the number of living cells. The live-cell protease becomes inactive upon loss of membrane integrity and leakage into the surrounding culture medium. (description adapted from vendor Promega)",,,,,
